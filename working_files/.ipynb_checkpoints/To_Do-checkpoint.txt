SVR Model - this post is a very good walk through of how to understand and use the model.

All values must be integer to work with SVR and multivariate plots. The 3D plots don't like float.

    - Mining Difficulty number is too long at 20 characters. Is it possible to drop any of the characters or convert to a manageable number?
    - Transfer Value is also a large number. Is it possible to drop any of the characters or convert to a manageable number?
    - Vader can't be converted to integer (I think) - may not be able to use.
    
We will need to pair down our features to 2 plus target(close price). I'm still trying to figure this out.

Once we decide to move forward with these two models, we need to run a few different scenarios where we are tweaking the parameters.

Focus on data visualizations
